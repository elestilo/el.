WooCommerce 2.1 will be the next version of our eCommerce plugin.

Starting the release of this version, we will stop support and compatibility for WooCommerce 1.x versions. Premium extensions will no longer be made compatible with the older 1.x versions.

## Refactor some more!
WooCommerce 2.1 is going to bring some more refactoring of the code to further make it future proof and better customisable.
