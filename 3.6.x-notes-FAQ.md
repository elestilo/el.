## What was deprecated in 3.6?
- `wc_get_min_max_price_meta_query` – removed in favour of lookup tables which remove the need to filter via post meta.
- Term meta helper functions – deprecated in favour of WP core term meta functions such as https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_term_meta/. These have not been needed since WP 4.4.
- `WC_Country::load_country_states` – States are now loaded on the fly as needed.
- `WC_Cache_Helper::delete_version_transients` – Transients are now versioned within the value negating the need for cleanup.
- `WC_Background_Updater` – We’ve switched updates to the ActionScheduler queue.
- `Simplify Commerce` – This gateway has been deprecated for several years and hidden in the UI. The code has now been removed.

## Will there be any database issues if I downgrade to 3.5.x after updating to 3.6.x?

There are 3 database upgrade operations in 3.6:

1. Create lookup tables for product data
2. Add an index to the product downloads table
3. Migrate `order` (sorting) meta for terms to a new naming structure.

1 and 2 won't cause issues on 3.5 because they work independently.

3 may cause your terms/categories to appear out of order if you had previously sorted them. They would need to be sorted again if you planned on sticking with 3.5.x and didn't have a database backup available to revert to.

## get_woocommerce_term_meta throws a deprecated notice, why was this wrapper deprecated?

This wrapper was put in place when WooCommerce implemented a term meta system long before WordPress has its own. When WordPress 4.4 released it's own version of term meta, these functions called both the custom functions, and the WordPress functions whilst they were transitioned to.

Since WooCommerce no longer supports WP versions lower than 4.4, the wrappers are no longer necessary and native Wordpress functions can be used instead.

## Emogrifier update
Emogrifier was [updated to version 2.1](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/22342) and the [way it's loaded by WooCommerce has changed](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/23151). 
The namespace name now needs to be specified to instantiate the class:

```
$emogrifier = new Emogrifier( $content, $css );
```

into:

```
$emogrifier = new \Pelago\Emogrifier( $content, $css );
```

Emogrifier is used by WooCommerce behind the scenes and only loaded where needed. We have no anticipated this being used by 3rd parties directly, so if you are a developer using this please get in touch with your use-case so we can consider (for example) a wrapper around this to prevent the need for direct calls/including core classes manually (which is likely to conflict in the future).
