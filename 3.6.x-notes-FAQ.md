## What was deprecated in 3.6?
- `wc_get_min_max_price_meta_query` – removed in favour of lookup tables which remove the need to filter via post meta.
- Term meta helper functions – deprecated in favour of WP core term meta functions such as https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_term_meta/. These have not been needed since WP 4.4.
- `WC_Country::load_country_states` – States are now loaded on the fly as needed.
- `WC_Cache_Helper::delete_version_transients` – Transients are now versioned within the value negating the need for cleanup.
- `WC_Background_Updater` – We’ve switched updates to the ActionScheduler queue.
- `Simplify Commerce` – This gateway has been deprecated for several years and hidden in the UI. The code has now been removed.

## `get_woocommerce_term_meta` throws a deprecated notice, why was this wrapper deprecated?

This wrapper was put in place when WooCommerce implemented a term meta system long before WordPress has its own. When WordPress 4.4 released it's own version of term meta, these functions called both the custom functions, and the WordPress functions whilst they were transitioned to.

Since WooCommerce no longer supports WP versions lower than 4.4, the wrappers are no longer necessary and native Wordpress functions can be used instead.
