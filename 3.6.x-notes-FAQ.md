# What was deprecated in 3.6?
- `wc_get_min_max_price_meta_query` – removed in favour of lookup tables which remove the need to filter via post meta.
- Term meta helper functions – deprecated in favour of WP core term meta functions such as https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_term_meta/. These have not been needed since WP 4.4.
- `WC_Country::load_country_states` – States are now loaded on the fly as needed.
- `WC_Cache_Helper::delete_version_transients` – Transients are now versioned within the value negating the need for cleanup.
- `WC_Background_Updater` – We’ve switched updates to the ActionScheduler queue.
- `Simplify Commerce` – This gateway has been deprecated for several years and hidden in the UI. The code has now been removed.
