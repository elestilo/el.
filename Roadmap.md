## 2.1 - Peppy Penguin

* Consider renaming 'shipping' in totals to 'shipping and handling'
* Add an update notification class so we can show messages to users before updating the plugin.
* Holding stock - See if more holds can be added to prevent simultaneous checkout.

**Credit notes**

* [#1507](https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/issues/1507) - Original refunds ticket.
* [#1982](https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/issues/1982) - Refunds do not work as we planned, so credit notes is now pitched as the way to go.

**Splitting CSS: Layout and pretty**

* Being able to disable **all** CSS or just the prettifying CSS (so layout remains in tact). 

**Coupons**

* Show coupons and amounts https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/tree/Coupon-display

**Account edit**

* Allow users to change email addresses, first and last names independently of billing email. Profile edit page - separate to billing/shipping.

**Full API**

* For querying orders, customers, products and report data.

## Ideas or future releases

**Custom stock statuses** [#3051](https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/issues/3051)

**ZONES**

**True multi-currency support**

**Promotions/special pages**

* [#2249](https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/issues/2249) - Add dedicated page for products in promotion

**Variations rewrite**

* [#1984](https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/issues/1984) - Validation for variations and more filters to affect the form behaviour.
* [#2399](https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/issues/2399) - Base product would define all properties (price, weight, stock, whatever) and variations can overwrite this for that specific variation.
