## Overview

Starting in version 3.1.0, WooCommerce has a built-in product CSV importer and exporter. You can easily import, export, and update hundreds or thousands of products on your WooCommerce sites. The importer and exporter support all types of products, including variations. This guide will walk you through using the importer and exporter and will also detail how to add custom import and export columns for developers.

## Importer

You can access the importer on the main "Products" admin screen:

Click the button to begin the import process.

### Upload CSV File Screen

**File upload:** CSV files should match [the importer CSV schema](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/Product-CSV-Import-Schema). If you are creating the files by hand, be sure to follow the schema otherwise your products will not import properly. If you are using a file generated by the exporter, everything should already be good to go.

**Update existing products:** If you have IDs and/or SKUs in your CSV file, the importer can update your existing products that have the same IDs or SKUs with information from the CSV. Check this box if you want this behavior, otherwise the importer will skip CSV products that have the same ID or SKU as an existing product.

**CSV delimiter:** (Advanced option) Generally CSV elements are separated by a comma. If you are using a different delimiter in your file you can set it here.
