## Variation actions/filters prefixes

`woocommerce_get_regular_price/sale_price` filters were in the abstract in 2.6.x. For products, these hooks are replaced with `woocommerce_get_product_regular_price` and `woocommerce_get_product_sale_price` and mapped so existing filters continue to function.

The exception is with product variations - these have their own hook prefix making them `woocommerce_get_product_variation_regular_price` and `woocommerce_get_product_variation_sale_price`. There is no mapping in place for these filters.

## Objects are passed by reference to actions/filters

If you're being passed a CRUD object via an action or filter hook, **changes you make to said object will persist**. If you need to change object properties without doing this, clone the variable.

```
// Create a clone to ensure item totals will not be modified permanently.
$item = clone $item;
```

## Variation IDs

In 2.6.x, `$variation->id` was the ID of the parent product, and `$variation->variation_id` was the ID of the variation. Backwards compatibility is maintained, but when moving to CRUD ensure you use the correct getters and setters. 

`$variation->get_id()` is the variation ID.
`$variation->get_parent_id()` is the parent product ID.

## Select2 Version 4

From WC Beta 2, we've migrated to Select2 V4.

Select2 V4 is mostly compatible with Select2 V3 with a few exceptions, the main one being how AJAX search inputs work. WooCommerce has two instances of these which are affected and need some HTML markup changes to function.

### wc-product-search inputs

These inputs were 'hidden' text inputs in v3. In v4 these needs to be changed to regular multiselect elements.

_Example:_

```
<input type="hidden" id="grant_access_id" name="grant_access_id" data-multiple="true" class="wc-product-search" style="width: 400px;" data-placeholder="<?php esc_attr_e( 'Search for a downloadable product&hellip;', 'woocommerce' ); ?>" data-action="woocommerce_json_search_downloadable_products_and_variations" />
```

Would be changed to a regular multiselect field:

```
<select id="grant_access_id" class="wc-product-search" name="grant_access_id[]" multiple="multiple" style="width: 400px;" data-placeholder="<?php esc_attr_e( 'Search for a downloadable product&hellip;', 'woocommerce' ); ?>" data-action="woocommerce_json_search_downloadable_products_and_variations"></select>
```

### Field name

Note that the field name in this case was changed from grant_access_id to grant_access_id[].

### Multiple attribute

`data-multiple` is no longer needed. The multiple prop is added instead. This supports multiple selections.

### Handling the POSTed data

In the previous example, the hidden input would have posted a comma delimited string of IDs. With the switch to multi selects, this code needs to handle an array of values instead.

### wc-customer-search inputs

Handled in the same way as `wc-product-search`.

### Checking POSTed data

Unlike hidden inputs, if no selections are made multi-selects do not POST. Your code needs to check if the field `isset()` to deal with posted values and handles scenarios where no selections are made.
