`woocommerce_get_regular_price/sale_price` filters were in the abstract in 2.6.x. For products, these hooks are replaced with `woocommerce_get_product_regular_price` and `woocommerce_get_product_sale_price` and mapped so existing filters continue to function.

The exception is with product variations - these have their own hook prefix making them `woocommerce_get_product_variation_regular_price` and `woocommerce_get_product_variation_sale_price`. There is no mapping in place for these filters.

If you're being passes a CRUD object via an action or filter hook, **changes you make to said object will persist**. If you need to change object properties without doing this, clone the variable.

```
// Create a clone to ensure item totals will not be modified permanently.
$item = clone $item;
```
